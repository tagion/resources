## About Tagion

Tagion is a universal token protocol. We aim to solve problems such as digital currency interoperability, inflation and deflation, decentralized governance, and scalability.

## Projects

Internal projects include:

- **Tagion Protocol** - combination of core protocols;
- **Tagion SDK** - tools for developers;
- **Tagion Node** - implementation of network node software;
- **Tagion Wallet** - implementation of basic wallet functionality.

All listed projects are either open-source or will be open-sourced soon, once the codebase and documentation is prepared for public.

## Differentiators

#### Hashgraph

Instead of Blockchain with proof of work, Tagion is based Hashgraph consensus mechanism. 

> It is an asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT) consensus algorithm that they consider capable of securing the platform against attacks. It does not use miners to validate transactions, and uses directed acyclic graphs for time-sequencing transactions without bundling them into blocks.

#### Decentralized Exchange Protocol

The Hashgraph enables the fair ordering of transactions in a decentralized manner. It makes possible to exchange digital currencies without trusting a middleman.


#### Inclusive Governance

Tagion has several layers of governance and built on democratic principles. The network and the code belong to all its users. More about governance on [Tagion Forum](https://forum.tagion.org/c/governance/8).

#### Elastic Money Supply

The fixed hard cap on money supply makes deflationary currency, creating an incentive to hold on to money instead of spending them, which is undesired due to economic reasons. Tagion solves it with an elastic money supply that will expand and contract depending on internal metrics that reflect adoption.

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

Carsten received an M.S. in Electromagnetic Field Theory from the Technical University of Denmark.

Carsten has a brilliant ability to combine deep technological understanding with visions for everyday applications. A talent that made him part of the Giga core team. Giga that later was sold to Intel in one of the biggest acquisitions in Danish business history.


### Kristian Vestergaard
